‼️ FAQ 1: How do I get my Free Air Quality API KEY? ‼️
The Infocal Air Quality watchface ships with a first-time use default api key to get you up and running right away.

Due to the popularity of this watch, the daily quota for this default key is being reached!
Once the quota is reached, Air Quality updates using the default key will result in "ERR 429" or "API KEY".  To resolve this error, create a free account and obtain a free api key from the IQAir Website:
https://dashboard.iqair.com/personal/api-keys

Once you have your free api key, you will need to copy this into the Watchface Settings (scroll to the very bottom of the Settings page and paste  into the text box):

‼️ FAQ 2: Why does my watch display "ERR 429" or "API KEY"? ‼️
This error means the quota for the included api key has been reached!
Please follow the instructions in FAQ 1 above to obtain your free api key and fix this issue.
