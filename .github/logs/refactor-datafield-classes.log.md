# Refactor DataField Classes to Individual Files - Log

**Date:** September 8, 2025
**Goal:** Move each class from grouped files to individual files while maintaining functionality

## Analysis Phase

### Current Structure
- **Already individual files (5):** SolarIntensity.mc, TimeToRecovery.mc, AirQualityData.mc, SunData.mc, MiscData.mc
- **Grouped files requiring refactoring (6):**
  - DeviceData.mc: 10 classes
  - ActivityData.mc: 9 classes
  - DateTimeData.mc: 6 classes
  - OpenWeatherData.mc: 4 classes
  - GarminWeatherData.mc: 4 classes
  - PhoneData.mc: 3 classes
- **Core infrastructure (1):** DataFactory.mc (BaseDataField, EmptyDataField + factory)

### Refactoring Decisions
1. **Individual files for most classes** - Each class gets its own .mc file
2. **Keep tightly coupled classes together:**
   - DateTimeData.mc classes (Time-related fields are interdependent)
   - Keep BaseDataField and EmptyDataField in DataFactory.mc (core infrastructure)
3. **Group related notification classes:**
   - PhoneData.mc classes can remain together (NotifyField, PhoneField, GroupNotiField are related)

## Planned Changes

### Files to create (individual classes):
- **From DeviceData.mc:** BatteryField.mc, HRField.mc, BodyBatteryField.mc, StressField.mc, BodyBatteryStressField.mc, ElevationField.mc, TemparatureField.mc, AlarmField.mc, BarometerField.mc
- **From ActivityData.mc:** ActiveField.mc, ActiveModerateField.mc, ActiveVigorousField.mc, DistanceField.mc, CaloField.mc, FloorField.mc, MoveField.mc, StepField.mc, WeekDistanceField.mc
- **From OpenWeatherData.mc:** TemparatureHLField.mc, TemparatureOutField.mc, WeatherField.mc, WindField.mc
- **From GarminWeatherData.mc:** TemparatureGarminField.mc, TemperatureHLGarminField.mc, WeatherGarminField.mc, PrecipitationGarminField.mc

### Files to keep grouped (with rationale):
- **DateTimeData.mc** - Time/date fields are tightly coupled and share common time handling logic
- **PhoneData.mc** - Notification-related fields work together for phone connectivity features
- **DataFactory.mc** - Core infrastructure (BaseDataField, EmptyDataField) should remain with factory

### Files Removed
- DeviceData.mc
- ActivityData.mc
- OpenWeatherData.mc

### Notes
- No explicit imports were found in the codebase for `datafield` classes, indicating that the build system automatically includes all files in the `source/datafield` directory.
- Imports were added to individual files as needed to ensure functionality.

### Issues Encountered
- None

### Next Steps
- Verify functionality through testing.
