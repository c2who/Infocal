# update-api-reference log

Objective
- Regenerate `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` from `source/datafield/` and include a detailed table of `FIELD_TYPE_*` enums with numeric index, class file links, purpose, Toybox modules, key API calls, and notes.

Actions taken
1. Read `source/datafield/DataFactory.mc` to extract the `FIELD_TYPES` enum order and the `buildFieldObject()` mappings. Preserved enum ordering for zero-based numeric indexes.
2. Read every `.mc` file in `source/datafield/` to extract class implementations, `using Toybox.*` imports, key API calls, and purpose based on code and inline comments.
3. Generated `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` containing a timestamped, GitHub-flavored Markdown table with one row per `FIELD_TYPE_*` entry (ordered by the enum). Each class name links to `../source/datafield/<file>.mc`.
4. Wrote this action log to `.github/logs/update-api-reference.log.md`.

Assumptions & decisions
- Assumed `FIELD_TYPES` enum order in `DataFactory.mc` determines the numeric index (zero-based). This follows the prompt instructions.
- Included only Toybox modules that are directly related to sensor/data retrieval (omitted `Toybox.Lang`, `Toybox.Application` where they were present but not directly related to the data source).
- When multiple FIELD_TYPE constants map to the same class (e.g., `FIELD_TYPE_CALORIES` and `FIELD_TYPE_CALORIES_ACTIVE` â†’ `CaloField`), each enum entry still has its own row as required.
- For table links I used relative paths starting with `../source/datafield/` (per the prompt). If the docs move, links may need adjustment.

Issues encountered
- No missing class files were found for any `FIELD_TYPE_*` values present in the enum and referenced in `buildFieldObject()`.
- Some files use helper globals (e.g., `Globals`, `BaseClientHelper`) and external client classes (`OpenWeatherClient`, `IQAirClient`) located outside `source/datafield/`. I referenced their usage without attempting to resolve their internal implementations.

Next steps (optional)
- Run a quick doc linter or preview to ensure table alignment renders as expected in GitHub.
- Expand module/call lists by scanning referenced helper classes (e.g., `Globals`, clients) if desired.
