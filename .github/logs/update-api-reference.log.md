# Update API Reference Log

**Model Used:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet
**Date Executed:** 2025-09-08
**Time Started:** UTC
**Time Completed:** UTC

## Objective
Update `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` to reflect that field classes have been moved from consolidated files to individual files, removing outdated file path references.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Analyzed Current Structure
- Examined the existing `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` file which contained outdated references to consolidated files like:
  - `DeviceData.mc` (containing HRField, BatteryField, etc.)
  - `ActivityData.mc` (containing CaloField, DistanceField, etc.)
  - `OpenWeatherData.mc` (containing weather-related fields)

### 2. Discovered Individual File Structure
- Used `file_search` to find all `.mc` files in `source/datafield/`
- Used `grep_search` to identify which classes are defined in which individual files
- Found that classes have been moved to individual files following the pattern `ClassNameField.mc`

### 3. Mapped Classes to Individual Files
Based on grep search results, identified the correct mapping:

| Class Name | Individual File |
|------------|----------------|
| `HRField` | `HRField.mc` |
| `BatteryField` | `BatteryField.mc` |
| `CaloField` | `CaloField.mc` |
| `DistanceField` | `DistanceField.mc` |
| `MoveField` | `MoveField.mc` |
| `StepField` | `StepField.mc` |
| `ActiveField` | `ActiveField.mc` |
| `FloorField` | `FloorField.mc` |
| `AlarmField` | `AlarmField.mc` |
| `ElevationField` | `ElevationField.mc` |
| `TemparatureField` | `TemparatureField.mc` |
| `WeekDistanceField` | `WeekDistanceField.mc` |
| `BarometerField` | `BarometerField.mc` |
| `TemparatureOutField` | `TemparatureOutField.mc` |
| `TemparatureHLField` | `TemparatureHLField.mc` |
| `WeatherField` | `WeatherField.mc` |
| `WindField` | `WindField.mc` |
| `BodyBatteryField` | `BodyBatteryField.mc` |
| `StressField` | `StressField.mc` |
| `BodyBatteryStressField` | `BodyBatteryStressField.mc` |
| `ActiveModerateField` | `ActiveModerateField.mc` |
| `ActiveVigorousField` | `ActiveVigorousField.mc` |

### 4. Files That Remain Consolidated
Some classes still remain in consolidated files:
- `DateTimeData.mc` - Contains multiple date/time related fields (AMPMField, TimeField, DateField, WeekCountField, CountdownField, TimeSecondaryField, BarometerField)
- `PhoneData.mc` - Contains phone-related fields (NotifyField, PhoneField, GroupNotiField)
- `GarminWeatherData.mc` - Contains Garmin weather API fields (TemparatureGarminField, TemperatureHLGarminField, WeatherGarminField, PrecipitationGarminField)
- `DataFactory.mc` - Contains EmptyDataField
- `MiscData.mc` - Contains CTextField
- `SunData.mc` - Contains SunField
- `AirQualityData.mc` - Contains AirQualityField
- `TimeToRecovery.mc` - Contains TimeToRecoveryField
- `SolarIntensity.mc` - Contains SolarIntensityField

### 5. Updated API_REFERENCE.md
- Updated all file path references to point to the correct individual files
- Maintained all existing content (purpose, API modules, API calls, notes)
- Only changed the "Class / Source File" column to reflect the new file structure
- Updated the timestamp to reflect the regeneration date

## Assumptions and Decisions Made
1. **Preserved Existing Content**: Only updated file paths; all other content (purpose, API modules, etc.) was preserved as it was already accurate
2. **Individual File Priority**: When a class was found in an individual file, that took priority over any consolidated file references
3. **Relative Path Format**: Maintained the existing `../source/datafield/` relative path format for links

## Issues Encountered and Resolutions
1. **Mixed File Structure**: Some classes exist in both individual files and consolidated files. Resolution: Used individual files when available.
2. **Multiple Classes Per File**: Some consolidated files still contain multiple classes. Resolution: Kept references to these consolidated files for the classes that haven't been moved yet.

## Final Status
- ✅ Successfully updated all file path references in `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`
- ✅ All 42 field types now point to their correct source files
- ✅ Maintained existing documentation quality and accuracy
- ✅ Preserved markdown formatting and table structure

## Files Modified
- `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` - Updated file path references

## Files Created
- `.github/logs/update-api-reference.log.md` - This log file

Assumptions & decisions
- Assumed `FIELD_TYPES` enum order in `DataFactory.mc` determines the numeric index (zero-based). This follows the prompt instructions.
- Included only Toybox modules that are directly related to sensor/data retrieval (omitted `Toybox.Lang`, `Toybox.Application` where they were present but not directly related to the data source).
- When multiple FIELD_TYPE constants map to the same class (e.g., `FIELD_TYPE_CALORIES` and `FIELD_TYPE_CALORIES_ACTIVE` → `CaloField`), each enum entry still has its own row as required.
- For table links I used relative paths starting with `../source/datafield/` (per the prompt). If the docs move, links may need adjustment.

Issues encountered
- No missing class files were found for any `FIELD_TYPE_*` values present in the enum and referenced in `buildFieldObject()`.
- Some files use helper globals (e.g., `Globals`, `BaseClientHelper`) and external client classes (`OpenWeatherClient`, `IQAirClient`) located outside `source/datafield/`. I referenced their usage without attempting to resolve their internal implementations.

Next steps (optional)
- Run a quick doc linter or preview to ensure table alignment renders as expected in GitHub.
- Expand module/call lists by scanning referenced helper classes (e.g., `Globals`, clients) if desired.
